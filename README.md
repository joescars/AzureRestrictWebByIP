# AzureRestrictWebByIP
Simple website containing web.config to restrict access by IP Address. 

This repo contains two small files. 
- index.php - simple file that outputs text to the browser
- web.config - contains an example of implementing ipsecurity to let you lock down your website to a specific ip address

Note XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX represents the IP address that you want to provide access to your website.
